<!-- ![2021-06-17 14_22_36-Raspberry_Pi_Server_Box - FUSION TEAM_cr](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84664789/124581373-584b9e00-de51-11eb-92b3-3103a6513776.png)-->

*Build your own DeFiNode on a Raspberry 4B*

*Installation guide for the DeFiChain on a Raspberry 4B 4GB-8GB RAM .*

**The DeFiNode is a do-it-yourself DeFiChain full node DeFiChain original source code. No code will be altered during installation and will 100% taken from the DeFiChain repository.**

## Basic Features (with the dedicated DeFiNode Case, there will be more features introduced)

* **Easy installation** (Easy mode and Expert mode)
* **All functionalities of the official full node GUI wallet app**
* **Can run a Master node***
* **Controlled by web browser** (From your PC or smartphone)
* **100% open source**

## Hardware Needed
Estimated cost around 80-120 USD - based on shops and location.

### Basic Amazon Shopping List (with the dedicated DeFiNode Case, there will be a separate shopping list)
*Please try to use the exact hardware models that are recommended in the shopping lists. A monitor and mouse keybord are needed for the initial setup*

* Raspberry 4 4GB (or 8GB) [amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/B07TC2BK1X)
* Power Supply US - USB-C, 5V, >=3A [amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/B07TSDJSQH)
* Power Supply EU - USB-C, 5V, >=3A [amazon link](https://www.amazon.de/Jun_Electronic-LadegerÃ¤t-Netzteil-Schalter-Raspberry/dp/B07TYYV8GF/)
* 256GB - Samsung FIT Plus Flash Drive [amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/B07D7Q41PM/) *min. 128GB version*
* Heatsink Case for RPi4 : [amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/B07W664LNN/)
* HDMI to micro HDMI adapter [amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/B07RZX9MCS/) 
* Depending on your monitor input, you will need a HDMI cable or a HDMI -> (DFI, VGA...) adapter
* Network cable to your router (you can use Wi-Fi if you have a good 5Ghz connection). Ethernet is recommended 


## Assemble your basic DeFiNode
When you have all parts you need to:

* Assemble the heatsinks on the Raspberry (follow the instructions in package).
* Plug in the network cable.
* **Do not switch it on yet** (We need to prepare the Samsung FIT Plus Flash Drive on your PC/MAC first)

Now your DeFiNode should look like this:

* Insert the Samsung FIT Plus Flash Drive into your PC/Mac
* Select Raspberry Pi OS 32Bit
* Select Samsung FIT Plus Flash Drive
* Click "Write" and follow the instructions

## Boot your DeFiNode

* Insert the Samsung FIT Plus Flash Drive into the Raspberry Pi (blue connector)
* Connect the Ethernet cable to you Raspberry Pi and router (check your DHCP router config if needed)
* Connect the micro HDMI adapter + cable to your monitor input
* Connect mouse and keyboard to the Raspberry Pi USB ports
* Use the switch to switch on the Raspberry Pi (LEDs should light up)
